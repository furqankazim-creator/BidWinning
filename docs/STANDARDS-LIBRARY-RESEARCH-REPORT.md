# Research Report: Implementing a Standards & Compliance Master Library

Based on the folders provided by the client (**International Standards** and **Saudi Aramco Standards**) and their feedback regarding "geographically bound compliance analysis agents" and a "master library," here is a detailed breakdown of what the client is asking for, what our system currently does, and the technical roadmap to bridge the gap.

## 1. What the Client Wants (The Vision)
The client has provided a massive repository of engineering laws and standards. 
*   **International Standards:** ASME, ASTM, NFPA (e.g., NFPA 20 for fire pumps), NEMA, IEEE, API, AWWA, etc.
*   **Local/Client Standards:** Saudi Aramco Engineering Standards (SAES), Materials System Specifications (SAMSS), Engineering Procedures (SAEP), and Inspection Checklists.

**The Goal:** The client does not want their engineers to manually read through thousands of pages of PDFs to verify if a bidder's proposal is compliant. They want these documents to act as a **Global AI Knowledge Base**. 
When a tender or a bidder's report is uploaded into the system, the LLM should automatically:
1.  **Identify** which standards apply to the project (e.g., recognizing that a water meter project requires SAES-S-040).
2.  **Retrieve** the specific clauses from those massive PDFs.
3.  **Cross-reference** the bidder's technical submission against those clauses to generate a **Compliance & Gap Analysis Report**.

## 2. What We Currently Do (VendorIQ's Current State)
Currently, VendorIQ is exceptionally good at **Tender-Specific Analysis**.
*   We allow users to upload specific tender documents (like a 12-page Scope of Work).
*   Our `/api/analyze` pipeline reads the document and extracts Requirements, Risks, Clarifications, and Deliverables.
*   **The Limitation:** Right now, if a Scope of Work says *"Must comply with NFPA 20"*, our AI logs it as a compliance requirement. However, the AI does not inherently know all the rules *inside* the 100+ page NFPA 20 PDF, because those PDFs are not loaded into the active memory of the tender. Loading hundreds of standard PDFs into every single LLM prompt is impossible due to token limits and cost.

## 3. How We Build What They Want (The Technical Solution)
To turn those folders into a "Subject-Matter Expert Library", we must implement a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Architecture**.

### A. The Master Library (Vector Database)
Instead of attaching PDFs to individual tenders, we need to create a global **Standards Library** in VendorIQ. 
*   We will parse all the PDFs (ASME, SAES, etc.) using OCR and text extraction.
*   We will split the text into small "chunks" (e.g., by clause or paragraph).
*   We will convert these chunks into vector embeddings and store them in a Vector Database (like Pinecone, MongoDB Vector Search, or pgvector).

### B. The AI Compliance Agent
When a bidder submits a technical proposal, our AI will act as a compliance auditor:
1.  **Search:** The AI extracts the keywords and standards mentioned (e.g., "flanges", "ASME B16.5").
2.  **Retrieve:** It silently queries the Vector Database and pulls only the 3 or 4 relevant paragraphs from the ASME B16.5 PDF.
3.  **Analyze:** It combines the bidder's proposal with the retrieved standard rules in a prompt, asking: *"Does the bidder's flange design meet these specific ASME rules?"*

### C. The Output (Bidder AI Analysis Report)
The platform will generate a detailed **Bidder Evaluation Report** that highlights:
*   ✅ **Compliant Items:** (e.g., "Bidder's scaffolding meets Construction Safety Manual Section 4.")
*   ❌ **Deviations / Gaps:** (e.g., "Bidder proposed DIN materials, but Saudi Aramco SAMSS-004 requires ASTM.")

## 4. Proposed Roadmap for VendorIQ
To execute this for the client, we need to build the following features:

| Phase | Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Global Document Vault UI** | Create a new section in VendorIQ (outside of individual tenders) where admins can upload, categorize, and update global standards. |
| **Phase 2** | **Ingestion & Indexing Pipeline** | Build a backend script that takes these heavy PDFs, extracts the text while preserving tables (using advanced parsers like LlamaParse or Unstructured), and indexes them into a Vector DB. |
| **Phase 3** | **Compliance Agent Integration** | Update our LLM prompt chain. Before generating a final review, the LLM will trigger a "tool call" to search the Master Library for any standards it needs to verify. |
| **Phase 4** | **Bidder Evaluation Dashboard** | Create a new tab in the Tender Workspace specifically for "Bidder Evaluation," where proposals are uploaded and automatically scored against the Master Library. |

**Next Steps:** Let me know if you would like me to begin scaffolding the database schema for the **Global Standards Library** or if we should start by building the UI for the Document Vault!

# VendorIQ — Spec coverage & verification (2026-09-22)

Each row maps a section of `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` to where it lives and how it is verified. Status: ✅ implemented & tested · 🟡 implemented, partial · ⏳ deferred by owner.

## How the whole system is verified
| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Type safety (frontend + API) | `npx tsc --noEmit` · `cd server && npx tsc --noEmit` | clean |
| Production build | `BUILD_DIR=.next-build npm run build` | clean, 129 routes |
| Every route returns 200 (or the intended 307) and renders with no client-side error in headless Chrome | route sweep | 128 × 200, 1 × 307, 0 errors |
| **Lifecycle test** — one tender walked through every tab, asserting each link (CRM→tender, docs, requirements→health, compliance, Go/No-Go→approval, registers, costing→pricing→approval→lock→new version, proposals→reviews, submission, result→CRM, contract, project, lessons, audit) | `npm run test:lifecycle` | 24/24 |
| **API smoke test** — signup/org/invite/roles/tenant isolation/sync/REST/settings/audit | `npm run api:test` | 17/17 |
| **Sync end-to-end** — signup → hydrate seeds org → edits sync → second session loads | harness | pass |
| **Live AI** — tender review JSON, document info, proposal/engineering drafts, chat | `/api/analyze`, `/api/chat` (Groq / Anthropic) | pass (13 s review on the Aramco SOW) |

## Known limits
1. Sync is last-write-wins per collection (debounced 800 ms); no field-level merge.
2. Uploaded files: extracted text is stored, the original binary is not (no object storage yet).
3. Exports are CSV / HTML-doc / JSON manifest, not native XLSX/DOCX/PPTX/ZIP.
4. Inquiry intake uses a mock inbox; the n8n/WhatsApp/email webhook is not wired.
5. Tender text over ~180k characters is truncated for analysis; chunking is the next step.

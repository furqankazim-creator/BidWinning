## Key rules
- **Source-based AI**: every AI finding carries source doc / page / section / clause + status (Needs Verification → Approved/Rejected). Never present AI assumptions as facts. Never fabricate competitor data ("Insufficient verified information").
- **AI governance**: log model, prompt version, timestamp, user, sources, input, output, confidence, review status, approver. AI never silently changes approved data.
- **Go/No-Go engine**: scored criteria → GO / CONDITIONAL GO / NO-GO; management override with reason.
- **Pricing**: lock approved price; any change = new price version.
- **Tender Health** (0–100) computed from real data: Requirements, Compliance, Documents, Technical, Commercial, Pricing, Risk, Submission.
- **Multi-tenant**: strict org isolation. Roles: Super Admin, Org Admin, BD, Tender Manager, Technical Manager, Engineer, Procurement Manager, Commercial Manager, Finance, Legal, Compliance, Project Manager, Reviewer, Executive, Viewer, Contractor/Vendor.
- **Audit trail**: immutable log of create/edit/view/download/approve/reject/price change/submit/status change.
- **Communication intake** (WhatsApp/Email via n8n → Laravel API): "Mark as Inquiry"; update existing inquiry / attach to existing tender / create new opportunity — no duplicates.

## 2. Client feedback on the AI review

| Topic | Client comment | Action in VendorIQ |
|---|---|---|
| Security of work site & materials yard | "Proper security … acceptable to Saudi Aramco" (General Note p.6) is **vague — a grey area** that must be clarified during bidding | New clarification **C-11** (see §3) |
| Permit receiver | SOW does not state that the **work permit receiver must be physically present** at site — a missing requirement | Requirement R-35 + clarification **C-12** |
| Standards | Standards list must be **consolidated** across fire protection, mechanical, electrical, plumbing | Requirement R-39 + clarification **C-13** + deliverable |
| Man-hours | Costing must show the **3,000 man-hour minimum** explicitly | Requirement R-32; current labour line is 6,800 crew-hours (≈13,600 man-hours) → satisfied, to be shown in the bid |
| Cybersecurity | Client policy: ISO 27001 for any cybersecurity/data component | Requirement R-40 + compliance item |
| AI method (Ahmed Masroor / Khan) | Interest in **GPG tools and ML agents tailored to geographically bound, tender-specific compliance analysis and document improvement**; a **master library of subject-matter experts** and **API integrations for data, probability and analysis** to be discussed in upcoming meetings | Roadmap items (see §6) |

## 3. Clarifications to send to Saudi Aramco (added)

| # | Ref | Category | Question |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-11 | General Note p.6 | Contractual | Please specify the required security measures for the work site and Contractor's materials yard (guarding hours, fencing, CCTV, access control, Industrial Security approvals) so bidders price a common basis. |
| C-12 | §3.3.5 / §6.0 | Technical | Please confirm that a certified work-permit receiver must be physically present at each active work location for the shift, and whether confined-space permits are anticipated (meter chambers/pits). |
| C-13 | §7.0 | Technical | Please confirm the applicable Saudi Aramco engineering standards for mechanical, electrical, plumbing and fire-protection systems affected by meter installation, to allow a consolidated standards list. |

These join the 10 clarifications already drafted from the SOW (smart-meter specification, quantity reconciliation 5,428 vs 3,758, table 1.2 rates, deadline/duration, preventive-maintenance scope, deduction basis, drawings/existing conditions, meter standards, sample approval lead time, water shutdown procedure).

## 7. Effect on the bid position

- Recommendation stays **CONDITIONAL GO**. The client's additions raise HSE/personnel cost slightly (OSHA-certified staff, third-party certifications, first-aid sizing) and add deliverables, but do not change the decisive conditions: smart-meter specification, table 1.2 rates, schedule, and the lump-sum hidden-works exposure.
- Tender metadata updated: *Minimum contractor man-hours = 3,000*; *Safety staffing = OSHA-certified officers & managers*.
- All items above are recorded as **human-sourced** (source "Client review meeting 2026-09-22", reviewer Khan, status Approved) — distinct from the AI-extracted items, which remain "Needs Verification" until accepted.

export const faq = [
  { q: "Is this only for Oil & Gas?", a: `No. ${brand.company} is industry-agnostic at its core. Oil & Gas, Infrastructure, Construction, Manufacturing, IT, Healthcare, Government and others are templates you enable — and you can build your own.` },
  { q: "Do I need a credit card to start the trial?", a: "Yes. A card is required to start the 3-day trial so the workspace is ready the moment you decide to continue. You are not charged until the trial ends." },
  { q: "What happens when the trial ends?", a: "After 3 days you are billed the standard monthly rate for the plan you chose, unless you cancel before the trial ends." },
  { q: "Can I cancel anytime?", a: "Yes. Cancel from Settings → Billing at any time; access continues until the end of the current billing period." },
  { q: "How does the AI avoid making things up?", a: "Every AI finding carries its source document, page and clause and enters as 'Needs Verification'. Nothing counts until a human approves it. Competitor data is never generated — only recorded with a source and confidence." },
  { q: "What counts against my AI credits?", a: "Every analysis, extraction, draft and chat turn consumes credits proportional to the tokens read and produced. Estimates are shown before each run." },
  { q: "Is my data isolated?", a: "Yes. Each organisation's users, clients, tenders, documents, pricing and AI data are isolated. See our DPA." },
  { q: "Can I switch plans?", a: "Yes. Upgrades apply immediately and are prorated; downgrades apply at the next billing date." },
